# Copy following channels on twitch

The Twitch Following Parser is a simple Chrome extension that makes it easy to copy a list of the users you are following on Twitch. With a single click of the "Copy" button in the extension popup, the current Twitch page is parsed for the names and urls of the users you are following and the resulting list is copied to your clipboard. The extension is easy to use and provides a convenient way to keep track of your Twitch followers.
